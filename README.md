# Using the codes I added here, you will be able to replicate the analyses I made for my thesis on nonfarm enterprises and conflict.

# To get the final dataframe, you should first prepare the enterprise-level dataframe (Dependent - Enterprise Level) and later aggregate the variables there using (Dependent - Household Level) 

# To create your control variables dataframe and add it to your main dataframe, use (Control - Household Variables) and (Control - Geographical Variables)

# (Exposure to conflict) will allow you to label households according to their conflict exposure. That code includes various types of conflict. If you are interested in a specific one, just run the related code. This will save you a lot of time. Single exposure check/labeling might take 40 min.
